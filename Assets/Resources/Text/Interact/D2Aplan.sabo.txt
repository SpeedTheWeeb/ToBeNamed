Peek:You know mates… Someone deliberately sabotaged the anchor rope!
Pirate:But who? What scabby sea bass would do such a thing?
Peek:And if the anchor ain't been pullin' her outta course,  we won't make it to Tortuga.. I wanted to try their best wine… Bilge-sucking the same old grog…
Witts:You're still gonna have that wine! Someone got to us. We've got to deal with that later, but If we don't act fast and decisively we are gonna sail right past the port_That boy at the doctors? Ate something wrong, yes?
Pirate:I heard he snuck into the pantry and took a bite of something one oughta not eat bites of
Witts:Well, would be a terrible shame if the rest of the crew got as sick as him, would it not? Then we would surely have to set sail straight for port._Heck, a few lucky souls may find themselves not very ill at all, and get to pick which port. We gotta find out what that kid ate!
Peek:Poisoning the whole scabbin' crew, and gettin round it ourselves.. is that not a little far fetched? Meanin’ how would we even make something like that happen?
Witts: Don't worry 'bout it peek! Stick to your guns, and tell Clean Hands his ship is on course. We'll work something out quick!
