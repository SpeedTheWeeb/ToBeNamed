Peek:Oy mateys! It seems like something has torn the rope for the anchor… That wasn't no human hands up there.
Pirate:My sails… The stories from old Blakebeard back in the day were right… The Giant Blake Crab might have just barely taken down the ship right under our rudders, but we got away with just the rope been torn, and the anchor swallow'd! 
Peek:If the Giant Blake Crab's around, and the anchor never got to pullin, then… How will we ever make it to Tortuga?! I wanted to try their best wine… Bilge-sucking the same old grog…
Witts:Give the Crab talk a rest, mates. If we don't act fast and decisively we are gonna sail right past the port._That boy at the doctors? Ate something wrong, yes? That gives me an idea for our occasion to stop
Pirate:I heard he snuck into the pantry and took a bite of something one oughta not eat bites of
Witts:Well, would be a terrible shame if the rest of the crew got as sick as him, would it not? Then we would surely have to set sail straight for port._Heck, a few lucky souls may find themselves not very ill at all, and get to pick which port. We gotta find out what that kid ate!
Peek:Poisoning the whole scabbin' crew, and gettin round it ourselves.. is that not a little far fetched? Meanin’ how would we even make something like that happen?
Witts: Don't worry 'bout it peek! Stick to your guns, and tell Clean Hands his ship is on course. We'll work something out quick!
