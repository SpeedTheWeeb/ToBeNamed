Witts:Friends, well done! Peek's been reading the sky this mornin' and we're on track! Anglin' towards from Tortuga
All pirates gathered:*Satisfied cackling*
Witts:Listen. We'll need an excuse to go to harbor, strong enough to sway the will of the crew. We have to necessitate a stop. I say we play hard. I say we dump all our provisions!
Pirate1:Dump our provisions? All our feed n' rum? Awfully expensive solution Witts. Sure that's worth it?
Witts(S.mate):Ain't noone dumping rum - we need to necessitate a stop. If the ship's outta feed, we’re going to have to seek shore. Nearest shore around is Tortuga._The plan will itself out. Besides, if we follow local customs, we'll pick some pockets, and make back the loss in no time.
Pirate2:So we ain't dumpin rum then? I'm not sure I could dump rum.
Witts: We're holding on the the rum, don't worry about that my friends. Would be undignified entering Tortuga sober!_As long as we’re careful what we drop, and how we drop it, it should all be smooth sailin'. Pick out the food carefully, and dump it out the stern. We don't want to wake the bow.
Pirate1:Aye. Tortuga… can't wait! But how's we going to cover for ourselves? The fact that the crates have been dumped, will be as clear as day!
Witts: “You're right, this is not an elegant plan. We're in a tight window to make this happen. This is a way to do it, that can be done tonight!_Most significant is this: We’re not going to be proven perpetrators of this, and we don't necessarily have to get back on the ship, when it leaves Tortuga.
Witts: “Way i see it, we need a real captain. This journey isn't going to bring him back, nor is it going to make a captain outta Clean Hands. Think about it, and if you’re in tonight, dump it all.”
