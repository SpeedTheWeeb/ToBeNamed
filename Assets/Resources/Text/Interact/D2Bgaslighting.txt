Clean-Hands:It's curious.. I do trust your judgment, Peek, but I can't quite match our position. We're slightly off the sun.
Peek:May be. Been posted in the nest all mornin'. It all tracks from up there. We may have dragged slightly, but will o the sea's the will o the sea._Could put'er portside, but I don't see any mess comin of the current course. I'll hop up n' check again if you want it?..
Clean-Hands:Don't bother lad, I think you're right. We'll reevaluate tomorrow. S'pose we're good for the day.
