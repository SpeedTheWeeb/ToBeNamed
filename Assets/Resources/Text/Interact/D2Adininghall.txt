Pirate3:You seen what's cookin' again out there in the ol' pots?
Pirate4:Aye, I seen it. That stew is downright . Rather eat the foam fresh off the sea. Can believe we all gotta eat that evry' mornin'.
Pirate3:Yerp.. Ain't gettin used to that. But we better. Ain't no graduatin' away from that stew. Even the Clean Hands slurps it down._Can't tell if he's just a team player, or he don't know that he could just have somethin' else.
Pirate4:Beats me why he would, but he always does. I'd never, that's for sure.Â
