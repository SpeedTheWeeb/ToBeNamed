Witts: All this Great Journey nonsense. We're wasting our time. We just hit a big score. We should celebrate, and drink to our departed captain. We shouldn't have to do it aboard this ship. I say we seek the shore, and spend some time enjoying our riches. An actual worthy sendoff for the captain.

Peek: Yeah, I guess. We're in welcoming waters, aye? Tortuga is just slightly off course from here, right?... Is that what you're thinking, sir?

Witts: You're reading my mind, my friend. That's exactly what I'm thinking. We'd have to send her off course slightly to excuse the stop. We can't let our dear Cap'n know, eh? He'd never go for it. Should we happen to get her properly off course, and close enough to shore, we should be able to excuse going to port somehow.

NVIP: How would we bring the ship off course? without nob'dy noticin'?

Witts: Peek, you'll have to play along. If anyone asks we're on course. We'll make sure to have the ship dragging starboard during the night. We could fix up a floating anchor, and throw it overboard the deck. In the morning, we'd be close enough to Tortugan waters, that it'd make sense to stop, should a proper occasion arise. All we would have to do is facilitate that occasion. We'll just have to make sure we're the last ones to tuck in, and the first to get up. Noone will notice.

Peek: Aye. I'll tie my tongue. Actually going to Tortuga... ain't that something!
